# Design Phase  
Transforming ideas into tangible solutions  

## Wireframes & Prototypes  
The design phase focused on translating user needs and ideation outcomes into practical, testable solutions.  
Using Figma, I created low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to visualize the SmartSave appâ€™s core features.

### Key Screens Designed

- **Notifications & Nudges** â€“ Reminders and motivational prompts  

### Visual Design Choices
- **Color Palette:** Calm greens and blues to build trust and reflect financial growth

- **Icons & Illustrations:** Minimal visuals to support engagement without clutter  
- **Layout:** Grid-based for easy navigation and scalability

## Next Steps
- **Usability Testing** â€“ Conduct testing with real users to validate the designâ€™s effectiveness  
- **Iteration** â€“ Refine UI/UX based on feedback and observed pain points  
- **MVP Development** â€“ Implement selected core features (expense tracking, savings goals, dashboard, reminders) into a functional prototype
